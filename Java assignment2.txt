1. What is statically typed and dynamically typed programming language?
Ans. If the memory of the variable is given during the compilation time itself  or for which data type is required for declaring the  
     variables such type of programming languages are called statically typed for e.g. Java,c,c++.

     If the memory of the variable is given during the execution time itself or for which data type is not required for declaring the
     variables such type of programming languages are called dynamically typed for e.g. python,javascript. 

2. What is the variable in java?
Ans. Variable is a container which stores some data or value.

3. How to assign a value to variable?
Ans. We assign a value to a variable in java according to this syntax : 
       data_type variableName = value;
     for e.g. int value = 5;

4. What are primitive data types in java?
Ans. Primitive data-types are predefined in languages. In java we have 8 primitive data types such as
     byte,short,int,long,float,double,char,boolean.

5. What are the identifiers in java?
Ans. Identifiers are the name of variable or method or classes which can uniquely identify them. Identifiers are user defined.

6. List the Operators in Java.
Ans. Following are the operators in java : 
     i. Arithmatic operators : +,-,*,/,%,++,--
     ii. Logical operators : &&,||,!
     iii. Comparison operators : >,<,>=,<=,!=,==
     iv. Assignment operators : =,+=,-=
     v. Bitwise operators : &,|

7. Explain about Increment and Decrement operators and give an example.
Ans. Increment operator is increase the value of operand by 1. for e.g. 
      int i = 15;
      i++;
      System.out.println(i); //It gives the result 16

     Decrement opreator is decrease the value of operand by 1. for e.g.
      int i = 15;
      i--;
      System.out.println(i); //It gives the result 14

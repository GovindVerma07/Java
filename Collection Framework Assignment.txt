1. What is the collection framework in java?
Ans. Collection framework is the group of classes and interface, It is used to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity.

2. What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?
Ans. (i) ArrayList uses a dynamic array whereas LinkedList uses doubly LinkedList.
    (ii) ArrayList provides random access whereas LinkedList doesn't provides random access.
   (iii) ArrayList is better to store and fetch data whereas LinkedList is better to manipulate data.

3. What is the difference between Iterator and ListIterator?
Ans. (i) By using Iterator we can move only towards forward direction and we can't move backward direction whereas by using ListIterator
         we can move in both directions forward and backward.
    (ii) By using Iterator we can perform only read and remove operations and we can't perform Addition of new objects and replacing new
         objects whereas by using ListIterator we can perform addition of new objects and replacing new objects operations and also read
         and remove operations.

4. What is the difference between Enumeration and Iterator?
Ans. (i) Enumeration concept is applicable only for lagacy classes whereas Iterator concept is applicable for both lagacy and collection
         classes.
    (ii) In Enumeration we can perform only read operation whereas In Iterator we can perform both read and remove operation.
   (iii) Enumeration is faster than Iterator.

5. What is the difference between List and Set?
Ans. (i) List can contain duplicate values whereas set doesn't contain duplicate values.
    (ii) The List is an ordered collection which maintains the insertion order whereas Set is an unordered collection which does not 
         preserve the insertion order.

6. What is the difference between HashSet and TreeSet?
Ans. (i) HashSet is implemented through Hash Table whereas TreeSet is implemented through BalanceTree.
    (ii) HashSet is an unordered set of collection whereas TreeSet is a sorted set of collection.
   (iii) HashSet uses less memory than TreeSet.

7. What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?
Ans. (i) Array is used only when size is fixed whereas ArrayList is used for dynamic size.
    (ii) Arrays are memory wise not recommended to use whereas ArrayList is memory wise recommended to use.
   (iii) In Array only homogeneous data are allowed whereas In ArrayList both homogeneous and heterogeneous data allowed.

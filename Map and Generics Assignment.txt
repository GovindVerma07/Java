1. What is a Map in java?
Ans. To represent a group of individual objects as a key value pair then we need to go for Map.

2. What are the commonly used implementations of Map in java?
Ans. The commonly used implementations of Map in java are HashTable, HashMap, LinkedHashMap and TreeMap.

3. What are the difference between HashMap and TreeMap?
Ans. HashMap is an unordered collection that usage hashing to store the key value pairs, while TreeMap is a sorted collection that stores
     the kay value pairs in a sorting order based on the natural order of keys.

4. How do you check if a key exists in a Map in Java?
Ans. We can check if a key exists in a Map in java using the containsKey() method or the get() method.

5. What are Generics in java?
Ans. Generics in java are used to provide type safety and reduce code redundancy by allowing the use of generic types.

6. What are the benefits of using Generics in java?
Ans. The benefits of using Generics in java are - 
     Type safety
     Code reusability
     Improved readability etc.

7. What is a Generic class in java?
Ans. A Generic Class in Java is a class that can work with different types of data. It is defined using a type parameter enclosed in 
     angle brackets, which represents the type of data being used.

8. What is a Type Parameter in java Generics? 
Ans.  A Type Parameter in Java Generics is a placeholder for the type of data that is used by a generic class or method. 

9. What is a Generic method in java?
Ans. A Generic Method in Java is a method that can work with different types of data. It is defined using a type parameter enclosed in    
     angle brackets, which represents the type of data being used.

10. What is the difference between ArrayList and ArrayList<T>?
Ans. ArrayList is a non-generic class, while ArrayList<T> is a generic class. ArrayList<T> provides type safety, as it can only store 
     elements of the specified type, whereas ArrayList can store any type of element.

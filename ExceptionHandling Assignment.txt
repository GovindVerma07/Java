1. Explain different types of Errors in java?
Ans. There are two types of Errors in java i.e. 
     (i) Syntax Error/CompileTime Mistakes: The errors which are occurs due to improper syntax in the code. It will occurs at the compile
         time.
     (ii) Logical Error/RunTime Mistakes: The errors which are occurs due to improper logic in the code. It will occurs at the run time.

2. What is an Exception in java?
Ans. An exception is an unwanted or unexpected event, i.e. occurs at the runtime. It disturbs the normal flow of the program.

3. How can you handle exceptions in java? Explain with an example.
Ans. We can handle exceptions in java by using try and catch block in which risky code is written in the try block and handled code is 
     written in the catch block. for e.g. - 
      try{
           System.out.println(10/0);
       }
      catch(Exception e){
           System.out.println("Exception is occur "+e);
        }

4. Why do we need Exception handling in java?
Ans. Exception handling is required to maintain the normal flow of the program. If exception is not handled then the program is terminated
      without executing the other statements.

5. What is the difference between exception and error in java?
Ans. Error: An Error indicates a serious problem that a reasonable application should not try to catch.
     Exception: Exception indicates conditions that a reasonable application might try to catch.

6. Name the different types of exceptions in java?
Ans. There are two types of exceptions in java i.e. 
     (i) Checked Exception : ClassNotFoundException, SQLException, IOException etc.
     (ii) Unchecked Exception : ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException etc.

7. Can we just use try instead of finally and catch blocks?
Ans. No, we can't use try instead of finally and catch blocks. It gives compile time error.

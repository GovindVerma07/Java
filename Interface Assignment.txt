1. What is an interface in java?
Ans. An interface is used in java to achieve 100% abstraction and multiple inheritance that is not possible in inheritance concept. An 
     interface can contain only abstract methods before the java-8.

2. Which modifiers are allowed for methods in an interface? Explain with an example.
Ans. All methods inside the interface are by default public and abstract if we declare or not. So, only public and default modifiers are 
     allowed in an interface. for e.g. - 
      interface calc{
       void method();
     }

3. What is the use of interface in java? Or, why we use interface in java?
Ans. An interface is used in java to achieve 100% abstraction and multiple inheritance that is not possible in inheritance concept. 
     Interface is used to achieve loose coupling.
     We use interface to increase the performance of code, provide security to code and remove the dependency. 

4. What is difference between abstract class and interface in java?
Ans. If we doesn't have complete implementation then we use abstraction whereas if we doesn't have any kind of implementation or zero
     implementation than we use interface.
     In interface every methods are by default public and abstract and data members are public static final whereas in abstract classes
     there is no boundation.

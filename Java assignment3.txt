1. What are the conditional operators in java?
Ans. Conditional operators checks the condition and decides the desired result on the basis of conditions.
     In java there are 3 conditional operators i.e. 
     i. Conditional AND (&&)
     ii. Conditional OR (||)
     iii. Ternary operator(?:)

2. What are the types of operators based on the number of operands?
Ans. In java there are 3 main categories of operators are : 
     i. Unary operators (unary plus (+),unary minus (-),increment (++),decrement (--),Not (!))
     ii. Binary operators (+,-,*,/,% etc.)
     iii. Ternary operator (?:)

3. What is the use of Switch case in java programming?
Ans. Switch case is used instead of multiple if-else statements. It is used to check multiple conditions and provide a convenient way to 
     select one of many code blocks to be executed.

4. What are the priority levels of arithmetic operators in java?
Ans. Increment or decrement > * or / > + or - .

5. What are the conditional statements and use of conditional statements in java?
Ans. Conditional statements are used to make decisions in program based on certain conditions. 
     2 type of conditional statements that are if-else and switch.

6. What is the syntax of if-else statement?
Ans. if(condition1){
            //if body
        }
     else if(condition2){
            // else if body
      }
     else{
            // else body
      }

7. What are the 3 types of iterative statements in java?
Ans. The 3 types of iterative statements in java are - 
     i. for loop
     ii. while loop
     iii. do-while loop

8. Write the difference between for loop and do-while loop.
Ans. for loop checks the condition first then execute body whereas do-while loop executes the body first then checks the condition.
     do-while loop executs their body atleast once whereas it is not true for for loop. 

9. Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10.
Ans. public class Example{
       public static void main(String[] args){
            for(int i = 1; i<=10; i++){
              System.out.println(i);
            }
         }
     }
